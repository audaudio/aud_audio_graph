# Use placeholder app IDs in the example

## Motivation

- The example app identified itself with an ID of the organization
  (`com.audanika.*`).
- A developer who copies the example would inherit that ID, and the
  example claimed an ID of the organization on devices and in stores.

## Strategy

- Replace the prefix by the placeholder `com.example`; the rest of each
  ID stays.
- Change nothing in the library.

## Implementation

- Android: `namespace`, `applicationId` and the Kotlin package folder.
- iOS and macOS: `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` of the app and of
  `RunnerTests`; Linux `APPLICATION_ID` and the Windows company name
  where present.
- The new IDs:
  - `com.example.audAudioGraph`
  - `com.example.aud_audio_graph`

## Result

- The example analyzes clean; no ID of the organization is left in it.
